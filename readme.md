Welcome to **Splash Games** — a clean, modern website project built to showcase games, blogs, and career opportunities for a fictional game studio.  
This site is built with pure **HTML**, **CSS** (custom properties/variables), and a touch of **JavaScript** for simple animations and interactive elements.

This project was designed as a personal challenge to sharpen front-end development skills, with an emphasis on **layout**, **styling**, and **responsive design principles**.

## 🌟 Project Goals

- Improve CSS layout and design techniques.
- Practice clean HTML5 structure with semantic tags.
- Implement simple JavaScript-driven interactions.
